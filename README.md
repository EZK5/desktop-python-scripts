This repository contains two Python scripts: one designed for my Windows personal computer to make all desktop apps hidden, and the other designed for my MacOS laptop to move all screenshots away from desktop to a separate folder, organised by date.

These above Python scripts may not be the most universally useful scripts out there, and by no means the most technically demanding, however they were genuinely useful projects to me personally, and reflect my passion to integrate technology and automation into everyday life.
